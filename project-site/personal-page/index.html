	<h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>My name is Konstantinos Mavrogeorgis and I was born at the 14th of December of 1997. 
           I am studing Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of 
           Athens and I am interested in software engineering. At my free time I enjoy watching movies 
           TV series or anime, play video games and read books mainly sci-fi ones.

        <h2>This site</h2>
        <p>While trying to get skillful at software engineering 
	    I created this page in order to learn and improve at web development. Click 
	    to the <a href="../project-page/index.html">Projects</a>
	    to see some projects I have made using javascript.
